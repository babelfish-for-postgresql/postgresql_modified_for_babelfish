## Babelfish for PostgreSQL

[![Build Status](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI%22)

This repository contains the PostgreSQL code base with a patch applied to
enable some additional functionality provided by the Babelfish extensions. The
Babelfish community strives to minimize the amount of changes to the PostgreSQL
database engine, and will be working with the PostgreSQL development community
to merge these changes into PostgreSQL where possible.
 
This repository is available for building patched PostgreSQL binaries. Patches
with the modifications to community PostgreSQL are made available with every
[Babelfish release](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions/releases).  
 
More information on Babelfish for PostgreSQL can be found at

Changes to community PostgreSQL that are unrelated to Babelfish should be made
through the PostgreSQL community. If you'd like to contribute to Babelfish,
please use [this repo](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions).
 
Babelfish would not be possible without the work and dedication of the hundreds
of people who have contributed to creation of PostgreSQL itself. Everyone
involved in the development of PostgreSQL has our gratitude.
